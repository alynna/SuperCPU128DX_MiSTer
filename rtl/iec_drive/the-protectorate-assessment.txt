I am aware of the existence of Lylat and related worlds.  (Though I was sure it was named Lylatia in our systems)

I: Anyway... The organization defending the Lylat system.  What is its name?
O: Usually something that translates to "Lajlætia Unified Planetary System" in the local language of who we're talking to

I: Does the Lylat system reside inside a nexus outside of a standard six dimensional spacetime structure that leads directly to other realities, realms or multiverses?
O: That may be an active area of research

I: Choose one of these that best describes the Lylat system and/or Lajlætia UPS:
1) The people of this realm are entirely fae.
2) Some people are fae, some are not.
3) We know fae exist but there are no sign of them in recent history.
4) There are no fae, and/or we have never encountered them.

O: There are legends of fae-like entities, both native and re-imported from human mythology, but most consider them just that, mythology.

I: On the following scale, please choose the closest tech level of the Lajiaetia UPS:

O: 7 going on 8

I: Please choose the closest magic level from this list.

O: What do you mean by "magic"?
I: The ability to effect a change in your current reality purely through will or the manipulation of probabilities.  The methodology of doing the former, is not relevant to the question.
O: Probability manipulation is an active area of research, hence our dip into Level 8 on your last question.
I: How far along are your people?
O: Some researchers think that doing so is going down a pointless rabbit hole, but there's usually no outright hostility.
I: Estimate its usability by the general population.
O: Not intentionally, yet
I: As a side question to help me gauge, was Krystal's staff magic, magitech, or tech?
O: It appears to be mostly technological, but with a power source I have yet to figure out. The in-game Dinosaur Planet had a lot more staff-activated stuff than the actual world it was based on, for gameplay reasons.
I: Hmm.  Says magic here, or "with magical properties".   I will classify it as magitech.  Gonna say magic level 4 for now, possibly 5 soon...

I: Rate the average proficiency, possibility and sociological awareness of magitech by Lylatians and/or the LUPS.

O: 2 sounds about right; as for rebuilding Cerinia, it's controversial whether that's a wise use of resources, or constitutes a world-scale grave desecration.

I: Using the human devised "d20" system of alignments, please classify the general alignment of Lylatians and the LUPS.
O: True neutral, leaning toward neutral good. I might be too close to fairly evaluate, I don't expect any intelligent people who aren't looking for endless fights to call themselves collectively evil.

I: We can always revise it later after observation.
I: Thank you for contributing your system to the Registry.  Now onto the deeper questions.

I: Has the LUPS developed, or have access to, star drives that can travel at least 50 light years per year (50c)?
O: 50c on a spacecraft is achievable, but resource-intensive and involves technology I'm not allowed to talk about. The gates depicted in Assault and Zero superficially resemble it.

I: The average number of distinct systems supporting intelligent life are about 78000 cubic light years apart, or about 42.8 light years away.  How long would it take your fastest starship to reach another world 42.8 light years away?
O: I'm not sure I can answer that.

I: Has the LUPS developed, or have access to, drives that use causality compression or causality avoidance in order to exceed c without violating it?
O: Nobody saw anything strange happen to the world the Aparoid homeworld was based on before it was "supposed" to happen, so yes?

I: Has the LUPS developed, or have access to, drives that use a universe wide mycelial network, such as a spore drive, to arrive anywhere in their universe in the next moment?
O: If we have, I certainly don't have the clearance to touch it.

I: Has the LUPS developed, or have access to, gridjumper drives or other technology that allows them to travel between multiverses?
O: No

I: Have the LUPS or Lylatian society granted the same status of personhood and equal rights to Programs or other AI technology that it has given to fleshy beings with spirits or other biological components?
O: The only such entities we've encountered with enough sapience to qualify were immediately hostile to us and the lone survivor of it essentially donated themselves to science.
O: I'm sure some lawyers would like to make a lot of money having a long, protracted argument about it though

I: From none, to the entire multiverse (inclusive of other realities and realms), what is the estimated level of range of ambition that the LUPS and the Lylatian people to explore the cosmos?
O: While most people are boundlessly curious about every corner of the universe, we also want to avoid accidentally invading inhabited areas, lest we get into unnecessary fights.

I: From none, to the entire multiverse (inclusive of other realities and realms), what is the estimated level of range of ambition that the LUPS and the Lylatian people have to protect other worlds and realms in the cosmos?
O: Attitudes range from "stick to stuff that's actually our responsibility" to "we'd love to help but don't know if it'd be appreciated or result in dependency" to "if we can help, we should"

I: From none, to the entire multiverse (inclusive of other realities and realms), what is the estimated level of range of ambition that the LUPS and the Lylatian people have to rule or otherwise conquest?
O: We're content with our position in the universe. There's plenty of literal space to go around, taking it from others just leads to problems for everyone.

I: What is the current range and reach of the LUPS with regards to worlds it protects or otherwise have charge over?
O: I'm not sure I'm cleared to answer that completely.

I: From 0, to 10, rate your estimate of the desire of the people of the Lylat System, or the LUPS, to join a multi-dimensional federated Protectorate of allied explorers, for the purposes of sharing information, protecting one another, and generally advancing the mutual interest of its members.
O: 5, I'd say.
